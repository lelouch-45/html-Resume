    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><h3>Distance measuring using Ultra-Sonic sensor</h3>
        In this, we use an ultra-sonic sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and the target object</p></li>
        <li><p><h3>Car Parking System</h3> 
        In this, we use Arduino UNO as thee brain of the project which tells us for how much time a car has been parked in a slot. The parked car is detected from a slot using IR sensor and timer starts running as soon as a car is detected. After the car left the slot, it calculates the parking fee with respect to the time it was been parked in the slot.</p> </li>    
        <li><p><h3>Solar Panel Cleaning Drone</h3> In this, we use a drone which is manually driven to clean the dusty solar panels using the water pump system mounted below the drone. An ultra-sonic sensor is been mounted below the drone in order to detect solar panels at a distance. As the solar panels are detected by the sensor, the water is pumped over the solar panel thus cleaning the dirt off the panels.</p></li>
